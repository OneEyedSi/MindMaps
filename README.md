# Mind Maps on Technical Subjects
Freeplane mind maps on a variety of technical subjects, from the year 2000 to the present.

Freeplane is a free mind mapping desktop application, the successor to Freemind.

## Navigation and Linking
The mind maps in this repository are linked together in a hierarchy.  ***MindMapsTopLevel_FileLinks.mm*** is the root or top level mind map.  All other mind maps can be reached directly or indirectly from the root mind map.  

Some topics linked to from *MindMapsTopLevel_FileLinks.mm* are covered by a single mind map.  Others, such as Azure or PowerShell, have a root "contents" mind map which links to multiple sub-topics.
